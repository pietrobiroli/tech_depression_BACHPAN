# Technology of skill formation in Bachpan up to 36 months (Data and Code)
This readmefile explains how to replicate the analysis in
Sevim, Baranov, Bhalotra, Maselko,  Biroli (JHR 2023)
"Trajectories of Early Childhood Skill Development and Maternal Mental Health"

Authors: Pietro Biroli & Dilek Sevim

Date: September 2023

Data and Code can be downloaded here: https://github.com/pietrobiroli/tech_depression_BACHPAN/

## How to replicate the results
### STEP 1:
- Download and unpack the zip file into a preferred location.
- Folder should contain the following elements
  -  folders:
      -  latex/
      -  

  -  execution files:
      -  

  -  data files:
      -  dataClean/Bachpan_clean.csv
      -  

### DATA ACCESS:
The replication files contain a publically available, cleaned, and anonymized dataset, Bachpan_clean.csv, which can be used to run the replication code in XXXX. 
Files XXX and clean raw data to produce Bachpan_clean.csv.

The raw data for this project are confidential and not publically available, but may be made accessible with Data Use Agreements with the Human Development Research Foundation http://hdrfoundation.org/. Researchers interested in access to the data may contact Pietro Biroli at pietro.biroli@unibo.it; It can take some months to negotiate data use agreements and gain access to the data. Completion of human subject research training may also be required (https://citiprogram.org). The author will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years following publication.
